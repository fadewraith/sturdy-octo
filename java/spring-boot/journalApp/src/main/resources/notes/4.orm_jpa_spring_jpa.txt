ORM is a technique used to map java objects to database tables.

JPA is a way to achieve ORM, includes interfaces & annotations that we use in our Java classes, requires a persistence provider (ORM tools) for implementation.
ex - hibernate, eclipselink

Spring Data JPA is built on top of JPA specification

controller -> service -> repository
@DbRef - to make the relation and for it, application.properties make it to true

@Transactional - to make it work, use @EnableTransactionManagement in main app

these 2 are used to manage internally - check main application
PlatformTransactionManager, MongoTransactionManager

./mvnw clean
./mvnw package
cd target
java -jar '.jar'
java -jar '.jar' --property=value
priority is given to command line argument, then application.properites, then application.yml
