    /**
     * 3 ways to declare string
     * String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
     * StringBuffer is thread safe but not StringBuilder
     * String is thread safe
     * String operations-
     * contains, equals, compareTo, indexOf, equalsIgnoreCase,, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, substring, length(), charAt(), lastIndexOf, chars()
     * compareTo - compares lexicographically
     * StringBuilder(mutable)
     * StringBuffer(thread-safe & mutable)
     * new methods of stringbuilder and stringbuffer -
     * append, insert, setCharAt, reverse, deleteCharAt, delete, replace, capacity
     * Static members can be accessed without creating an object
     * Statis methods cannot access non static members
     * Non statis methods can access static member
     * Static methods do not have access to this reference
     * Although static variables can be accessed and modified outisde of static methods, its good to do inside static members
     * final k/w can be used at 3 places -
     * Variable(local, instance and class) - no reinitialization
     * methods - no overriding
     * class - no inheritence
     * */
