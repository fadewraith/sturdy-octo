- The problems where the locally-optimal choice leads to a global solution are the best fit for the Greedy technique.
- The greedy method can optimally solve a problem that satisfies the below-mentioned properties:

  - Greedy choice property: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
  - Optimal substructure: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

Greedy algorithms work by recursively constructing a set of pieces from the smallest possible constituent parts. Recursion is an approach to problem-solving in which the solution to a particular problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
