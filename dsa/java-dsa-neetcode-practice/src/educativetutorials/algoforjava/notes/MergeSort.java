     * Merge sort is a recursive divide and conquer algorithm that essentially divides a given array into two halves, sorts those halves, and merges them together in order. The base case merges two arrays of size 1 so that, eventually, the single elements are merged in order; the merge part is where most of the heavy lifting happens.
